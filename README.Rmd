<!-- ****** Description ****** -->

This repository hosts code packages for acquiring and calculating geolocation data for NEON data products.

<!-- ****** Usage ****** -->
## Usage
The code packages in this repository contain functions with two related purposes: (1) to acquire geolocation data via the NEON API, and (2) to calculate more precise geolocations, where possible, than NEON publishes directly. Only a subset of all NEON data products and named locations are covered by these code packages. See help files for individual packages and functions for details.
