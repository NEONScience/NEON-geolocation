Description: NEON spatial data are provided in a variety of ways: spatial data are present in data tables 
    in observational data products, and in the sensor_positions files provided with instrumented data products, 
    while airborne data are inherently spatially explicit. In addition, the NEON location database is accessible 
    via the public API. The geoNEON package contains basic shared functions for accessing spatial data via the 
    API, and for calculating more precise locations for terrestrial observational data than are provided in the 
    data tables.
